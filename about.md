<p>
I am a software engineer based in Japan with many years of experience
building and maintaining web applications for the Japanese market. I believe in
quality code and quality communication, and see the two as intimately related.

A Canadian originally from Montreal, I first came to Japan as a researcher
and later discovered a love for programming. I have headed international teams
in public organizations and private companies, tackling problems ranging from
disseminating scientific discoveries to integrating legacy payment systems.
The common thread linking these roles is the importance of clear communication
to quality results.

I currently spend my days developing the foundations for commerce
as a Staff Developer on the Ruby and Rails Infrastructure team at
[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com). I also contribute actively to many
open-source projects, including
[Mobility](https://github.com/shioyama/mobility), a Ruby gem for translating
model data, and Ruby on Rails.

### Specialties

- Ruby on Rails internals (especially ActiveModel/ActiveRecord)
- Payment integration
- E-commerce and logistics
- Internationalization and localization, translation management
