I am a frequent speaker at technology conferences in the United States, Europe
and Japan. My specialty is presenting difficult concepts in a way that is easy to
understand.

I'm available for speaking opportunities, [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you
think I might fit the bill.

### Caching Without Marshal <span class="side-note">@ RailsConf 2022</span> {#caching-without-marshal}

Marshal is Ruby's ultimate sharp knife, able to transform any object into
a binary blob and back. This makes it a natural match for the diverse needs of
a cache, but with risks. <a
href="https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#session-1360">In this talk</a>
I pry open Marshal to show it works and how our team at Shopify replaced
it with MessagePack, a safer, more compact binary serialization format.

### The Elusive Attribute <span class="side-note">@ RailsConf 2019</span> {#the-elusive-attribute}

Ruby on Rails is famous for its “magic”, but there is very little out there
explaining how that magic actually works under the hood. In this talk <a
href="https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-751" target="_blank">I
gave at RailsConf 2019</a>, I pick apart the magic underlying one of the most
basic elements of Rails: its **attributes**.

### Building Generic Software <span class="side-note">@ RubyConf 2018</span> {#building-generic-software}

In this presentation <a
href="https://rubyconf.org/2018/program.html#session-715" target="_blank">given
at RubyConf 2018</a>, I introduce the concept of Inversion of Control (IoC)
through an example where we walk through the steps of building a framework.
The framework ends up being a simplified version of [Mobility](/projects#mobility).

### Metaprogramming For Generalists <span class="side-note">@ EuRuKo 2018</span> {#metaprogramming-for-generalists}

Metaprogramming is the machinery that enables Ruby's diverse gem ecosystem, its
intuitive DSLs, and its flexible frameworks. But it is also demonized and
misunderstood. In this talk, which <a href="https://euruko2018.org/schedule/"
target="_blank">I gave at EuRuKo 2018</a> in Vienna, Austria, I explain why
metaprogramming is so important for building the generic components we depend
on every day.

### The Ruby Module Builder Pattern <span class="side-note">@ RubyKaigi 2017</span> {#the-ruby-module-builder-pattern}

Did you know that Ruby has configurable modules? One of the most interesting
features of Ruby, the Module Builder Pattern is also probably its least
well-known. In this talk <a
href="https://rubykaigi.org/2017/presentations/shioyama.html"
target="_blank">given at RubyKaigi 2017</a>, I explain this powerful
feature through simple, concrete examples.
